Itâ€™s exciting to be able to use past experience to develop something new and unique for a market that is untapped considering this type of development. I always strive to be unique in personal and professional settings. Turquoise is an opportunity for me to be a part of the creation of something unique and special for local residence. I hope that the design and sense of place catches on to continue similar projects for the region in the near future."
